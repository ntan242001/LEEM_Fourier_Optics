# Fourier Optics for Image Formation in LEEM

## Description
This project contains programmes that simulate and analyse images formed by Low Energy Electron Microscopy (LEEM). The principle and calculations are based on the following articles: 
* [K.M.Yu et al 2019 Ultramicroscopy 200, 2019, 160-168](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2019.01.015)
* [A B Pang et al 2009 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 21 314006](https://doi.org/10.1088/0953-8984/21/31/314006)


## Installation
The programmes are written in Python 3 with common libraries such as numpy, matplotlib. Users are recommended to install Anaconda and edit the programmes with Jupyter Notebook or Spyder.
